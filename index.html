            <p>The <b>Ayala Young Leaders Congress (AYLC)</b> is a concrete expression of the Ayala group’s commitment to national development. It is the keystone of “Shaping Tomorrow’s Leaders,” the youth leadership development program launched in 1998 by the Ayala group of companies as a strategic investment in the youth, and ultimately, in the future of the country. Ayala’s dream is to form and nurture a network and community of values-based and principled Filipino leaders who are passionately committed to nation building and to uplifting the lives of their fellow Filipinos. The AYLC is a student leadership summit participated in by eighty outstanding student leaders selected from the best colleges and universities across the country. The Congress is designed to build the participants’ confidence and hone their leadership skills, to nurture commitment to integrity and principled leadership, to foster nationalism and idealism, and to encourage faithful stewardship of their communities and the country’s future.The four-day youth congress includes talks, panel discussions, outdoor activities, and workshops. The talks and panel discussions enrich and challenge the participants’ perspectives and paradigms as prominent leaders from government, civil society, business, the arts, media, and entertainment share their leadership stories and experiences. The outdoor challenges help build a community of learning and develop a sense of self-efficacy, trust, and teamwork. The workshops help participants gain insight and internalize learnings for real-life application as they discuss their experiences in small groups.
